# i3-gaps-debian
Tool to create (and optionally install) Debian packages of _i3-gaps_.

## How does it work?
It uses the newest stuff from [here](https://github.com/Airblader/i3),
makes some modifications (only if necessary for the _building step_)
and finally produces common Debian packages.

## Why does it exist?
_i3-gaps_ simply does not exist in Debian (so far).

## Works for what?
Debian _jessie_ and later.

## Credits
Thanks to [stapelberg](https://github.com/stapelberg) for creating
[i3](http://i3wm.org/) and [Airblader](https://github.com/Airblader)
for the _gaps part_.  (Of course, also thanks to _anyone else_ contributing to _i3_.)
