# i3-gaps-debian
Tool to create (and optionally install) Debian packages of _i3-gaps_.

## What does it?
It automatically clones [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3),
does some modification (only if necessary for the _building step_)
and finally produces _common Debian packages_, which could be
easily installed.

## Why does it exist?
_i3-gaps_ simply does not exist in Debian (so far).

## Credits
Thanks to [stapelberg](https://github.com/stapelberg) for creating [i3](http://i3wm.org/) and [Airblader](https://github.com/Airblader) for the _gaps part_.

## Beer
Hey, I'm [thirsty](http://gunbomber.org/donation.html)... _;-)_
